# FARDEEP
Fast And Robust DEconvolution of Expression Profiles (FARDEEP) is a new machine learning tool for enumerating immune cell 
subsets from whole tumor tissue samples. FARDEEP utilizes an adaptive least trimmed square to automatically detect and 
remove outliers before estimating the cell compositions. This folder contains the R-package and codes for generating the results in our paper.
